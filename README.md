# houseganpp-gui-utility
Capstone Project Phase B. While experimenting the model, struggled with editing the input data (jsons). Hence, developed a GUI utility for editing the jsons according to the structure of the repository [houseganpp](https://github.com/ennauata/houseganpp).

### Features
- User-friendly interface for navigating and modifying JSON files, which are the input data for [houseganpp](https://github.com/ennauata/houseganpp) model.
- Easy to compare between desired floorplan to output floorplan and graph.

### How to Use
- Launch the utility.
- Load an existing JSON file, or start from scratch.
- Edit the neighbours as necessary.
- Generate the floorplan - here the pretrained model is running on CPU.
